The party explores the dungeon of the Dead Three
After the dungeoncrawl they manage to save Burthock's life and he shares information:
    1) Someone was after his life, he was knocked out in the street and found himself here.
    2) The bathhouse above this dungeon belongs to some noble
    3) Someone is sponsoring The Dead Three to slaughter people on the streets
    and wreak panic. He doesnt seem to know why though.
    4) His mother is one of the Lords in the city council
    5) They are not on good terms, though.
    6) He has a lot of brothers and they dont really get along well
    7) He suspects that it might've been one of them.

The Lord's Shield is hidden under the Vanthampur Villa, where Thavnius Kreeg
Tries to force the demon inside of it to speak. The Lord knows a lot about infernal
magic/machinery and helped to create Companion 50 years ago. Having knowledge too vast though,
Zariel decided to put him out and charged Bel with disposing of him. Bel, however, just to spite
Zariel, spared Lord's life and forged his soul into this shield.
The Lord really hates devils for this betrayal, and he has a lot of info on how exactly
The Companion works. He will not part with this knowledge so lightly, though. He will deceive 
and betray everything and everyone just to get his freedom. He doesnt hold much to his pride,
as deteriorated as it may be at this point. Few other devil lords want to reclaim this soul,
trapped inside the Lord's shield, and send their agents into the mortal world. One of them slips
into the destroyed magic workshop and takes the role of its keeper, just to lie and have his job
done by someone else, maybe even gaining few souls along the way. PCs have signed a contract
to bring him this shield, so for now he'll patiently wait.
